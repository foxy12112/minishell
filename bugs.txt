1. The problem i have is that if i remove quotes too early that may cause the problem
with tokenizing
2. therefore variable expansion and checking for legit quotes should happen in the beginning
3. but final quotes removal should happen inside already tokenized shell commands

So my tasks are: 

1.Write A function which checks if quotes are correctly placed - if not return error
 -it has to be looked at and analyzed - but is finished
2.fix variable expansion if variable is inside single quotes
 -
3.write separate function which is responsible for removing quotes which should be removed

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. change variable expansion code
2. add variable expansion into heredoc
3. edit heredoc functions
4. fix exit problems - fixedooooo
