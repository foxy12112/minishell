THINGS TO DO NOW: 
-Check if variable key is in single quotes and if not do variable getting if there is no \ in front of $sign



1. typing $(ls) in heredoc, cat << EOF
2. assigning variable like this var=key" opens heredoc

IMPORANT 

IF WE SEE $SIGN WITH \ in the back - its necessary to take $ sign as it is and dont look for variable
